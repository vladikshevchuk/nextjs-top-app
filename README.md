This project is a high-performance web application developed using Next.js and TypeScript. It leverages the benefits of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with static page generation to achieve excellent performance and search engine optimization (SEO).

In addition to Next.js and TypeScript, the project also utilizes CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, which were covered as part of the course. The use of these technologies allows for creating a visually appealing and interactive user interface.

### Here are some key aspects and tools used in the project:

- TypeScript: TypeScript is used to enhance the development experience by providing static typing and improved code organization.

- Figma: The project involved working in Figma, a popular design tool, to create the visual layout and design of the application.

- React Hooks: React Hooks are utilized for managing state and providing reusable logic throughout the application.

- Context: The Context API is employed to handle global state management, enabling data sharing across components efficiently.

- Next.js Routing: Next.js routing system is used to implement smooth navigation and handle different routes within the application.

- CSS Grid: The CSS grid layout is utilized to create a responsive and flexible layout for the application's user interface.

### Libraries:

- react-hook-form: This library is used for building complex and flexible forms with ease.
- Framer Motion: Framer Motion is used to add smooth and engaging animations to the user interface.
